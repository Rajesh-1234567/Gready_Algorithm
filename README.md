# Gready_Algorithm
A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the best possible decision at each step without considering the consequences of that decision on future steps.

The key idea behind greedy algorithms is to make a series of choices that, at each step, seem to be the best option. Greedy algorithms are often used for optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution from a set of feasible solutions.
